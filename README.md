# Crowdsourced Porn Blacklist

Goal:
The goal of the crowdsourced porn blacklist (cspbl) is to create a single shared hosts file that can be used to block most porn sites. 

Personal motivation:
I, like many people, struggle with viewing pornography on my laptop and phone. So far, the best way I have found to block sites is using the "hosts" method. More about that here (https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/block-websites-using-hosts-file/)

Please use this file! As you discover sites that are missing, please do a pull request and we'll take a look and add them.

# Things on this list
1) Porn sites
2) Torrent sites with pornography
3) Image hosting sites with pornography
